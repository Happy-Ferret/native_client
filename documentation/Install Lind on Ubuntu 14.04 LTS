General Instructions for Installation: 
https://lind.poly.edu/projects/project/wiki/InstallLindFromSource


*****************************************************************************
Problems & Solutions:

Setting up Lind environment:
1.Install the needed libraries
1.1 sudo apt-get ia32-ibs would fail:
Package ia32-libs is not available, but is referred to by another package.
This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
is only available from another source
However the following packages replace it:
  lib32z1 lib32ncurses5 lib32bz2-1.0
E: Package 'ia32-libs' has no installation candidate

Because Ubuntu 14.04 doesn't support ia32-lib any more.

Solution: 
install the suggested replacement libs through apt-get

2.Setup Google depot-tools
Google updated their gclient code, and the new version of gclient.py doesn't work for lind at the moment.
Use an old version of gclient.py. (We have backup file for this)

3.Setup environment variables

set the following environment variables in ~/.bashrc 

export LIND_SRC=/usr/lind_project/lind
export REPY_PATH=/usr/lind_project/repy
export NACL_SDK_ROOT=/usr/lind_project/repy/sdk
export LIND_MONITOR=/usr/lind_project/reference_monitor
export PATH=/usr/lind_project/depot_tools:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/glibc/

[*** note ***]: the last one(LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/glibc/) is a path in Repy's file system. 
All the other paths are in the actual host file system.
Because LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used by the NaCl loader, therefore, it is able to interprete the Repy path correctly.

4.Build lind
4.0
NaCl's git urls were removed!
So now, we need to copy the following directories in nacl/native_client/tools/SRC/
To build correctly, need lind/nacl/native_client/tools/SRC/binutils, SRC/linux-headers-for-nacl, SRC/newlib, SRC/gdb, SRC/glibc_orig, and SRC/gcc

4.1 for latest version of texinfo, 2 errors: unknown command `colophon', unknown command `cygnus'. 

Solution:
1) Remove current texinfo: sudo apt-get remove texinfo
2) Download the texinfo source (old version):
   wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-4.13.tar.gz (We have backup file for this, in case the url got removed!)
3) Extract the source files:
   gzip -dc < texinfo-4.13.tar.gz | tar -xf -
   cd texinfo-4.13
4) Configure, build and install:
   ./configure
   make
   sudo make install

4.2 need gperf to complete building
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gperf

***potential problem***
If you did the building before having gperf installed, then there will be an empty /gcc/cp/cfns.h created, which will cause "undefined reference to libc_name_p" error.
To solve this, delete /gcc/cp/cfns.h file and run the building again with gperf installed.


5.Build reference_monitor (NOT used currently!)
5.1 encounter error: "/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lcurl", although curl has been installed and is the newest version. 

Solution:
Need the libcurl3-dev package. Curl is just the command line utility. The library is libcurl3, and it has a -dev package.
Use: sudo apt-get install libcurl3-dev

6.Run reference_monitor (NOT used currently!)
6.1 /usr/lind_project/reference_monitor/src/main/reference_monitor /usr/lind_project/reference_monitor/src/lind_test/utf/build/testcases/test_exit.o
Aborting
/usr/lind_project/reference_monitor/src/lind_test/utf/build/testcases/test_exit.o: error while loading shared libraries: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0: cannot read file data: Operation not permitted

Solution: 
Not solved yet.
